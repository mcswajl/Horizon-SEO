# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Yes, I could not get my <aside> box to align with the bottom of the last <section> box. In my CSS file I tried to resize both the <sections> and the <aside> elements. I need to study CSS page layouts more.
  
<head>
changed title from "website" to "Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc."
</head>

<body>
changed <div class="header"> to <header> I didn't see the need for a class called .header I edited the CSS to use the header element instead of the class.
Added the <nav> element to replace <div>
Added search titles to each li a href under nav
</body>

<section> put the class =hero into a section and added the alt text. Still seems like I am missing something in this
section
Replaced all the div classes with sections and added img id= instead of thediv class.
Also added alt= to each section following the image src.

<aside> portion
For the sidebar of the page I added <aside>. This allowed me to remove the divs and  
all the classes, this also made CSS file shorter.
Not sure if I needed to add the img id= but I did anyway. In my opinion, another user can read this new code
and better understand what the html code will display.
